### Product Context:

Students at Penn State Behrend often have questions on topics such as connecting to the campus Wi-Fi network and which events they should attend to add to their college experience. This software will provide to students a resource with which they can quickly receive the answers to these queries, reducing the workload for IT help desk employees and Welcome Week staff.

This chatbot system, LionChat, will be accessed by users over the Facebook Messenger application, and will provide users with information relating to IT help, things to do in Erie, and Behrend events. Administrators for the system can access the chatbot’s analytics information over a webpage.

### Statement of System Scope:

The software will determine the user’s intent and retrieve the relevant information from an SQL database. The answer response time per asker query should be a maximum of 10 seconds.  Relevant analytics information such as user ratings, frequently asked questions, and incorrectly classified questions will be retrieved from the database and displayed on a webpage for the administrator users.
